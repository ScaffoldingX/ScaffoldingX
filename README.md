# ScaffoldingX

Machine learning to accelerate 3D bioprinting.

Scaffoldingx aims to leverage the power of machine learning techniques to radically improve design, material tuning, process optimization, and in situ monitoring of 3D bioprinting tissues.

3D bioprinting has quickly become one of the leading segments of the 3D printing industry. Thanks to 3D printing techniques, cells and biomaterials can be combined and deposited layer by layer to create biomedical developments that have the same properties as living tissues. During this process, various “bio-inks” (a combination of cells and gel) can be used to create tissue-like structures. This field has opened the possibility of creating synthetic skin, cornea or bladders for regenerative medicine, organoids for high throughput testing of drugs, and scaffolds for producing cultured meats. 

The bioprinting field faces challenges due to sub-optimal selection of materials, design of scaffolds, and struggles with viability of printed tissues. Machine learning techniques can design appropriate materials, determine the concentration of these materials, and predict scaffold structure to radically improve current bioprinting protocols.
